    # Introduction
    
    The PaD API provides an easy way to integrate both client and server-side 
    with our __Billie Pay After Delivery (PaD)__ platform.
    
    _Billie PaD_ is a Business to Business (B2B) platform that enables you (the merchant) to accept invoice payments from
    other business customers without having to wait for the money to arrive, caring about reminding customers to pay,
    or taking over any credit risk.
    
    Based upon your contractual agreement with Billie, your customers will have 14, 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 days (payment terms) 
    to pay your invoices while Billie will transfer the money to you immediately after shipment of product or fulfilment of
    service obligation.
    
    If customers get late with paying their outstanding invoices, Billie will also take over reminding customers on your behalf 
    (white label solution). In case of your customer's bankruptcy, Billie fully covers this default for you.

    ## Authentication
    For authentication and authorisation the API requires some requests to include valid API credentials via HTTP headers.
    Different keys are used for the `sandbox` and `production` environments, which are completely independent
    meaning that they cannot access or alter data from the other.
    
    To obtain your credentials for both environments please contact us or send an email to: pad@billie.io.
    
    ## OAuth 2.0
    The API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
    
    This authentication mechanism is based on the OAuth 2.0 prototocol and requires a Client ID, a Client Secret Key and
    in some flows also a user (email) and password.
    
    With these credentials, the client should request a token using the [oauth/token](#operation/oauth_token_create) endpoint,
    which should be used in the `Authorization` header together with the `Bearer` challenge to authenticate all the requests.
    
    > Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c`.

    ## Order States
    
    | State       | Description                                                                                   |
    |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | waiting     | The order creation failed and needs a manual operation in order to be approved or declined    |
    | authorized  | The order is valid but it needs a confirmation from the merchant in order to be approved      |
    | created     | The order is successfully approved and Billie can offer financing for this transaction        |
    | declined    | The order was declined and no financing is offered for this transaction                       |
    | shipped     | The order was successfully shipped by the merchant                                            |
    | paid_out    | The outstanding amount for the respective order was successfully paid out to the merchant     |
    | late        | The payment of the outstanding amount is overdue                                              |
    | complete    | The outstanding amount was successfully paid back by the customer                             |
    | canceled    | The order was canceled by the merchant       
    
    ## Order State Transitions
    
    ![img](src/Resources/docs/orders-workflow-public.png)
    
    ## Order Decline Reasons
    
    An order could be declined by any of these reasons:
    
    | Reason                | Description                                               |
    |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
    | debtor_address        | Debtor address or name mismatch                           |
    | debtor_not_identified | Debtor could not be identified with the information given |
    | risk_policy           | Risk decline                                              |
    | debtor_limit_exceeded | Financing limit of debtor currently exceeded              |
    
    
    ## Usage of Virtual IBANs
    
    Since the money gets paid out to the merchant directly after shipment of the product or delivery of the agreed service, 
    customers need to transfer the money directly to Billie when their invoice is due. Therefore Billie is using virtual IBANs 
    that are delivered back to the merchant as an answer of a API order creation request. Virtual IBANs are unique for each of 
    your debtor / customer. The virtual IBAN needs to be put on the invoice which the customer receives for the purchase.

    ## Incoming Webhooks
    To send updates on relevant events, Billie PaD sends POST requests to the incoming webhook URL provided by the merchant.
    The following events can be communicated via webhooks:
    
    
    ### Webhook Authentication
    The authentication for webhooks sent from Billie to the merchants incoming webhook URL depends on the merchant specifications 
    and needs, but one possibility is sending the Billie API Key via headers:
    Examples:
     - `Authorization: Basic THE_API_KEY`
     - `X-Api-Key: THE_API_KEY`
     - `X-Another-Custom-Header: THE_API_KEY`
    
    The merchants will need to verify on their server side the authentication mechanism and credentials.
    
    ### Webhook Requests
    
    A `POST` request is sent to the configured merchant Webhook URL with one of the API Key headers mentioned above,
    the `application/json` Content-Type and the following body format:
    ```
    {
        event: (string) (event name, -check the following section for more details-)
        order_id: (string)
        amount: (string) (optional) (contains sum of paid amounts)
    	open amount: (string) (optional) (contains sum of outstanding amount)

        ### Client credentials grant
        
        This grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication, for example for use in a cron job which is performing maintenance tasks over an API. Another example would be a client making requests to an API that don’t require user’s permission.
        
        #### Flow
        
        The client sends a POST request with following body parameters to the authorization server:
        
        * `grant_type` with the value `client_credentials`
        * `client_id` with the client's ID
        * `client_secret` with the client's secret
        * `scope` with a space-delimited list of requested scope permissions.
        
        The authorization server will respond with a JSON object containing the following properties:
        
        * `token_type` with the value `Bearer`
        * `expires_in` with an integer representing the TTL of the access token
        * `access_token` a JWT signed with the authorization server's private key
        
        
        ### Authorization code grant
        
        The authorization code grant should be very familiar if you've ever signed into a web app using your Facebook or Google account.
        
        #### Flow
        
        ##### Part One
        
        The client will redirect the user to the authorization server with the following parameters in the query string:
        
        * `response_type` with the value `code`
        * `client_id` with the client identifier
        * `redirect_uri` with the client redirect URI. This parameter is optional, but if not send the user will be redirected to a pre-registered redirect URI.
        * `scope` a space delimited list of scopes
        * `state` with a [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) token. This parameter is optional but highly recommended. You should store the value of the CSRF token in the user's session to be validated when they return.
        
        All of these parameters will be validated by the authorization server.
        
        The user will then be asked to login to the authorization server and approve the client.
        
        If the user approves the client they will be redirected from the authorization server to the client's redirect URI with the following parameters in the query string:
        
        * `code` with the authorization code
        * `state` with the state parameter sent in the original request. You should compare this value with the value stored in the user's session to ensure the authorization code obtained is in response to requests made by this client rather than another client application.
        
        ##### Part Two
        
        The client will now send a POST request to the authorization server with the following parameters:
        
        * `grant_type` with the value of `authorization_code`
        * `client_id` with the client identifier
        * `client_secret` with the client secret
        * `redirect_uri` with the same redirect URI the user was redirect back to
        * `code` with the authorization code from the query string
         
        Note that you need to decode the `code` query string first. You can do that with `urldecode($code)`.
        
        The authorization server will respond with a JSON object containing the following properties:
        
        * `token_type` with the value `Bearer`
        * `expires_in` with an integer representing the TTL of the access token
        * `access_token` a JWT signed with the authorization server's private key
        * `refresh_token` an encrypted payload that can be used to refresh the access token when it expires.
        
        
        ### Implicit grant
        
        The implicit grant is similar to the authorization code grant with two distinct differences.
        
        It is **intended to be used for user-agent-based clients (e.g. single page web apps)** that can't keep a client secret because all of the application code and storage is easily accessible.
        
        Secondly instead of the authorization server returning an authorization code which is exchanged for an access token, the authorization server returns an access token.
        
        #### Flow
        
        The client will redirect the user to the authorization server with the following parameters in the query string:
        
        * `response_type` with the value `token`
        * `client_id` with the client identifier
        * `redirect_uri` with the client redirect URI. This parameter is optional, but if not sent the user will be redirected to a pre-registered redirect URI.
        * `scope` a space delimited list of scopes
        * `state` with a [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) token. This parameter is optional but highly recommended. You should store the value of the CSRF token in the user's session to be validated when they return.
        
        All of these parameters will be validated by the authorization server.
        
        The user will then be asked to login to the authorization server and approve the client.
        
        If the user approves the client they will be redirected back to the authorization server with the following parameters in the query string:
        
        * `token_type` with the value `Bearer`
        * `expires_in` with an integer representing the TTL of the access token
        * `access_token` a JWT signed with the authorization server's private key
        * `state` with the state parameter sent in the original request. You should compare this value with the value stored in the user's session to ensure the authorization code obtained is in response to requests made by this client rather than another client application.
        
        ****Note**** this grant does <u>not</u> return a refresh token.
        
        
        ### Password credentials grant
        
        Also known as the Resource owner password credentials grant.
        This grant is a great user experience for <u>trusted</u> first party clients both on the web and in native applications.
        
        #### Flow
        
        The client will ask the user for their authorization credentials (ususally a username and password).
        
        The client then sends a POST request with following body parameters to the authorization server:
        
        * `grant_type` with the value `password`
        * `client_id` with the the client's ID
        * `client_secret` with the client's secret
        * `scope` with a space-delimited list of requested scope permissions.
        * `username` with the user's username
        * `password` with the user's password
        
        The authorization server will respond with a JSON object containing the following properties:
        
        * `token_type` with the value `Bearer`
        * `expires_in` with an integer representing the TTL of the access token
        * `access_token` a JWT signed with the authorization server's private key
        * `refresh_token` an encrypted payload that can be used to refresh the access token when it expires.
        
        
        ### Refresh token grant
        
        Access tokens eventually expire; however some grants respond with a refresh token which enables the client to refresh the access token.
        
        #### Flow
        
        The client sends a POST request with following body parameters to the authorization server:
        
        * `grant_type` with the value `refresh_token`
        * `refresh_token` with the refresh token
        * `client_id` with the the client's ID
        * `client_secret` with the client's secret
        * `scope` with a space-delimited list of requested scope permissions. This is optional; if not sent the original scopes will be used, otherwise you can request a reduced set of scopes.
        
        The authorization server will respond with a JSON object containing the following properties:
        
        * `token_type` with the value `Bearer`
        * `expires_in` with an integer representing the TTL of the access token

        The following information can be updated until the order reached state complete:
        
        - order amount: decrease the order amount (mostly due to partial cancellations of a purchase), always possible 
          unless the order is already fully paid.
        - duration: extend timeframe for a payment. This changes the due date (§1).
        - invoice details like invoice number and document URL.
        
        
        §1 This call can also be used to move the due date into the future. This is possible from the moment the shipment is 
        confirmed until the last day before reaching the current due date.
        
        The new duration is to be set (i.e. initial request for 30 days, shipment on the 01.01., due date = 31.01., 
        update duration on 45 days, new due date = 15.02.).

      description: |
        This authentication mechanism is based on the OAuth 2.0 prototocol and requires a Client ID, a Client Secret Key and
        in some cases also a user and password.
        
        With these credentials, the client should request a token using the `POST /api/v1/oauth/token` endpoint,
        which should be used in the `Authorization` header together with the `Bearer` challenge to authenticate all the requests.
        
        > Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c`.
