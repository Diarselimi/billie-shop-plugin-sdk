# Introduction

The PaD API provides an easy way to integrate both client and server-side 
with our __Billie Pay After Delivery (PaD)__ platform.

_Billie PaD_ is a Business to Business (B2B) platform that enables you (the merchant) to accept invoice payments from
other business customers without having to wait for the money to arrive, caring about reminding customers to pay,
or taking over any credit risk.

Based upon your contractual agreement with Billie, your customers will have 14, 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 days (payment terms) 
to pay your invoices while Billie will transfer the money to you immediately after shipment of product or fulfilment of
service obligation.

If customers get late with paying their outstanding invoices, Billie will also take over reminding customers on your behalf 
(white label solution). In case of your customer's bankruptcy, Billie fully covers this default for you.
