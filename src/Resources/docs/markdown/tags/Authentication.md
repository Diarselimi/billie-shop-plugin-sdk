For authentication and authorisation the API requires some requests to include valid API credentials via HTTP headers.
Different keys are used for the `sandbox` and `production` environments, which are completely independent
meaning that they cannot access or alter data from the other.

To obtain your credentials for both environments please contact us or send an email to: pad@billie.io.
