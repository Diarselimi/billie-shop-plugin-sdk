>By creating an invoice, you will ship that order based on the amount the invoice has.

`Ex:` If you have an order of `500 Euro gross` and you want to partially ship it, just create an Invoice with the amount of `250 Euro gross`, and the order will move to `partially_shipped` state.

> To move the same order in state shipped you need to create another invoice for that same order with another 250 Euro gross.
