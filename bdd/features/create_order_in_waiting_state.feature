Feature:
  Depending on the merchant risk check settings, an order should be in waiting state if some risk checks failed.

  Background:
    Given I add "Content-type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I add "X-Test" header equal to 1
    And I add "X-Api-Key" header equal to test
    And The following risk check definitions exist:
      | name                      |
      | available_financing_limit |
      | amount                    |
      | debtor_country            |
      | debtor_industry_sector    |
      | debtor_identified         |

      | company_b2b_score         |
      | delivery_address          |
    And I get from companies service get debtor response
    And I get from payments service get debtor response
    And The following notification settings exist for merchant 1:
      | notification_type | enabled |
      | order_waiting     | 1       |
